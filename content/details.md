Impact of built environmental factors on COVID-19 infection at high-density communities: a case study in Shenzhen

	Supervisor: Rongpeng Zhang, Professor, Hunan University,08/2022-03/2023

	• Identified and assessed the main built environment elements that affect COVID-19 infection rates in high-density communities in Shenzhen, while highlighting the differences in impact between high-density and regular communities. 
	
	• Used Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Truncated Models to create a relationship between built environment factors and COVID-19 infection rates, conducting statistical analysis through R software. (Published in ‘Healthy Buildings 2023 Asia and Pacific Rim’)

Analyzing the drive of Population mobility on epidemic risk in megacity using metro data

	Supervisor: Sheng Jiao, Professor, Hunan University, 10/2022-Until now

	• Developed a theoretical model evaluating the connection between population mobility (considering travel distance and volume) and epidemic risk, based on metro data. 

	• Utilized Shenzhen metro data to construct an index system, quantifying the impact of population mobility on epidemic risk, which facilitated the identification of varying risk regions.
